# zipcodes
Dataset containing all zipcodes from Belgium and The Netherlands with their respective municipality and coordinates. I've had some occurrences where a zipcode or municipality wasn't in the set, so if that's the case, feel free to file an issue and I'll see if I can add it!

## Sources
The data was collected using various sources. For Belgium I used two sources, because I couldn't find one complete set that had all villages in the appropriate languages.

- Belgium: [geonames](http://www.geonames.org/postal-codes/codes-postaux-belgique.html) & [opzoeken-postcode](http://opzoeken-postcode.be)
- The Netherlands: [geonames](http://www.geonames.org/postal-codes/postal-codes-netherlands.html)

The data from _opzoeken-postcode_ was scraped using the script included in this repo.

## Usage
Feel free to use this dataset or contribute to improve it!
